This assignment consist of multiple parts. You can write the parts into same script file right after another.

2. Print the value of the variable to the console.
3. Add code that asks a text line from the user (*use* **IO.gets**).
4. Add text *<- You said that* to the text that user entered.
5. Print the combined text into the console.

### **Part 4**
1. Write an anonymous function that takes three parameters and calculates a product (multiplication) of those three values.
2. Ask three numbers from user (*use* **IO.gets** and **String.to_integer**) and pass them to your function created in step 1.
3. Print the result to the console.
4. Write an anonymous function that concats two lists and returns the result.
